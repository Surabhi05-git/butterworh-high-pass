exp 9 - butterworh-high-pass - In Image Processing and Machine Vision (IPMV), a Butterworth High Pass filter is used to attenuate low-frequency components and emphasize high-frequency components in an image. This filter is designed to remove low-frequency noise and smooth out the image, while preserving and even enhancing the high-frequency details such as edges, textures, and fine structures. The Butterworth High Pass filter achieves this by using a mathematical function to calculate the weights of neighboring pixels, with higher weights assigned to pixels with higher frequency components. The resulting filtered image has a sharper and more detailed appearance, making it useful for applications such as image sharpening, edge detection, and texture analysis.
